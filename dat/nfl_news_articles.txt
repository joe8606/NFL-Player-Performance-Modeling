The first surge of 2025 NFL free agency was closer to a ripple than a full-crested swell.

With a shallow crop of free agents, most clubs prioritized retaining their own and spending on extensions. Outside of a few big-money deals, most of the market has been relatively rational -- certainly, there was no Kirk Cousins, $180 million for a QB coming off an Achilles injury type of move.

We'd known for months that it would be a mostly muted frenzy compared to past years. The market was mostly flooded with 30-somethings on the back nine of their careers. The slow-moving receiver market (pun partially intended), where many well-known names still linger into the second and third waves, underscores the lesser appetite from clubs to shell out for aging players.

Moves will still percolate. Players will still find jobs. Aaron Rodgers will eventually choose a home. The Cincinnati Bengals drama must still unfold. And, of course, the draft is a significant touchstone. Trades may happen. And extensions will surely occur this summer, as always. But the biggest free-agent signings are mostly done.

As with all offseason acquisitions, some will pan out better than others. I've been tasked with sorting out what I deem the best and riskiest moves of the initial free agency foray. I won't row down every stream, as plenty of other voices have already provided commentary on the winners and losers each step of the way.

NOTE: Players are listed with the ages they will be on Sept. 4, when the 2025 NFL season is set to kick off.

The first phase of NFL free agency is coming to a close. Many teams have made significant splashes or at least given us a glimpse of the direction they are taking this offseason. Some of the moves have been expected. Others? Not so much.

Here are some developments that really stuck out to me at the beginning of a new league year.

It can take some time for a new head coach to make his mark on an organization. That's not the case in Chicago. Bears fans hoped the team would quickly turn over a new leaf with Ben Johnson at the helm, and it appears the franchise has done just that -- at least on paper. The new head man previously led a Lions offense that was built to flourish behind a top-tier offensive line, and general manager Ryan Poles has wasted zero time in attempting to put that blueprint into action in Chicago.

The trades for proven veteran guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and the signing of center Drew Dalman show how urgently this organization wants to help Caleb Williams take a big leap in Year 2. Williams, who was sacked a league-high 68 times as a rookie (16 more than the next-closest quarterback, Houston's C.J. Stroud), is unbelievably gifted. The No. 1 overall pick in last year's draft has the pieces around him (D'Andre Swift, D.J. Moore and Rome Odunze, among others) to improve and help Chicago close the gap in the NFC North. The biggest thing missing last season was stability up front -- that and good, consistent play-calling, which Williams now has with Johnson.

There's plenty left to do in Chicago, but the early moves -- albeit unsexy -- signal to the rest of the NFC North that the Bears are coming to play in 2025.

Indianapolis Colts general manager Chris Ballard said last month that Anthony Richardson will have to compete for the starting job in 2025 after a 2024 campaign in which he completed just 47.7 percent percent of his pass attempts (the lowest mark among starting quarterbacks), was temporarily benched for Joe Flacco and missed time due to injury. We now know he'll be competing with Daniel Jones, who gets the opportunity to make the most of a one-year prove-it deal (much like Sam Darnold had with the Vikings heading into 2024). Jones spent six years with the Giants -- going 24-44-1 as the starter -- and was released midway through last season before signing with Minnesota, where he spent a majority of his time on the practice squad.

The Colts now have two quarterbacks who are in some ways mirror images of one another, though Jones has four more years as a pro under his belt than Richardson. Both players excel as rushers but struggle with inconsistency in the pass game due to their lack of feel and vision in the pocket. And both players have battled injuries.

Competition could bring out the best in Richardson and Jones, who have each shown flashes in the NFL. It'd be the ideal scenario for Indy, which is looking to boost an offense that ranked 13th overall and 17th in scoring last season. My concern is that the Colts' attack won't improve no matter which of these two quarterbacks is under center.

Before last season even ended, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported that the New York Jets would be back in the quarterback market this offseason. And the franchise's history with a number of signal-callers on the QB carousel only heightened intrigue. In recent years, New York's had many passers flame out, only to leave and experience success elsewhere.

The first QB domino to fall earlier this month was Geno Smith, who was traded from the Seahawks to the Raiders. The veteran began his pro career in New York as the Jets' second-round draft pick in 2013 but lost the QB1 job after two inconsistent seasons and some injury woes. Geno eventually revitalized his career in Seattle, making a pair of Pro Bowls.

Meanwhile, Seattle's new quarterback, Sam Darnold -- who signed a three-year, $100.5 million deal with the Seahawks -- has a similar story, having entered the league as the No. 3 overall pick of the Jets in 2018. After three rough years with New York, Darnold made stops in Carolina and San Francisco before enjoying a breakout campaign in Minnesota this past fall, ultimately leading to the big payday as a free agent.

Now the football world is waiting to see where Aaron Rodgers, whose ill-fated tenure with the Jets has been well-documented, ends up. But Gang Green's charting a different course at quarterback in 2025 -- and there's reason to hope the team will finally enjoy some success at the game's most important position.

The franchise completely switched gears, going from a veteran pocket passer to a young, mobile quarterback in Justin Fields, who signed a two-year, $40 million pact. Having just turned 26, the former first-round pick gets a fresh start after three roller-coaster years in Chicago and a quick stop in Pittsburgh that saw him benched after helping the Steelers start last season at 4-2. Fields joins a team in New York with talented offensive weapons -- including receiver Garrett Wilson (his former teammate at Ohio State) and running back Breece Hall -- as well as a new offensive coordinator (Tanner Engstrand) and pass game coordinator (Scott Turner). Fields is at his best directing a simplified offense that showcases his athleticism with run-pass options/zone reads and his arm with shots downfield -- much like how the Philadelphia Eagles run their offense with Jalen Hurts. If Engstrand and Turner can design the attack around Fields' strengths, perhaps this is the quarterback move that finally sticks for the QB-starved franchise.

At this time last year, the Washington Commanders had just hired new head coach Dan Quinn and were in the midst of a spending spree that made them one of the free agency winners in 2024. Soon after, Washington struck gold in the draft with quarterback Jayden Daniels, who would go on to lead the team to the NFC Championship Game in Year 1, running away with Offensive Rookie of the Year honors in the process.

Nowadays, general manager Adam Peters and Quinn are understandably in win-now mode, putting them in the conversation to win the offseason for a second straight year, despite having less money to spend this time around. Washington began by bolstering an offense that ranked seventh in yards and fifth in scoring last season, trading for Laremy Tunsil (acquired from the Texans) and Deebo Samuel (49ers). Tunsil is one of the best left tackles in the NFL, having recorded the highest Pro Football Focus pass-blocking grade (92.0) among tackles since 2018 (min. 2,500 pass block snaps). Samuel is a do-it-all playmaker who can elevate Kliff Kingsbury's offense. Washington also gave veteran defensive tackle Javon Kinlaw a lucrative deal after releasing longtime staple Jonathan Allen (now in Minnesota).

In addition to those splashy moves, the Commanders have smartly re-signed pieces on both sides of the ball. The offense returns backup QB Marcus Mariota, RB Jeremy McNichols and tight ends John Bates and Zach Ertz, the latter of whom finished second on the team in targets (91), catches (66), receiving yards (654) and receiving TDs (seven) last season. Pro Bowl linebacker Bobby Wagner is back for Quinn's defense. In addition, the re-signings of kicker Zane Gonzalez and punter Tress Way were crucial under-the-radar moves.

A handful of additional moves didn't necessarily follow the themes above, but they still caught my eye. Let's quickly go through them:

================================================================================

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/qb-kenny-pickett-does-view-himself-as-a-starter-joining-browns
The only healthy quarterback currently on the Cleveland Browns roster, Kenny Pickett is first in line for snaps this offseason.

Pickett, however, understands competition will be imported in the form of another veteran and possibly a rookie.

The 2022 first-round pick of the Steelers still sees himself as a starter after being benched in Pittsburgh and sitting behind Jalen Hurts in Philadelphia for a year.

"I do view myself as a starter," Pickett said Thursday. "I'm sure they're going to bring in another veteran and who knows what else, but I'm just excited to be here and compete with whoever. All the quarterback rooms I've been in, each room's been really tight. We all pull for each other. That's really what it's all about: getting better together and making the team better. So definitely prepare for whatever situation that may present itself."

The Browns acquired Pickett in a trade with the Eagles in exchange for Dorian Thompson-Robinson and a fifth-round pick. The clubs essentially swapped depressed quarterback assets.

Moving to Cleveland, where Deshaun Watson is anticipated to miss the entire season, at least opens the possibility of Pickett playing a role in 2025.

"I just think it's a great opportunity to go compete again," he said. "That's really all you can ask for. That's what I was told here, coming in here, having an opportunity to compete again. So I'm very excited for that."

The Browns also brought in Russell Wilson for a visit on Thursday. Pickett dismissed the veteran's presence in the building on the same day as his introductory presser.

"Yeah, that's fine with me," Pickett said. "As long as I have a chance to compete, that's all you can ask for. So having that opportunity is awesome as a player, so I'm looking forward to working with whoever comes in the building."

Pickett went 14-10 as the starter in two years with the Steelers, completing 62.6% of his passes for 4,474 total yards with 13 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. He led one of the least explosive offenses in the NFL over that span. The 26-year-old played fine in chunks of two games with the Eagles, starting one, but exited with an injury to his ribs.

A game-manager with little upside, Pickett profiles as a backup quarterback at this point. With the No. 2 overall pick, the Browns could draft an immediate starter or bring in a Wilson-type to leapfrog Pickett for a season. For now, however, Pickett will prepare to compete for reps this offseason.

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/mason-rudolph-returning-steelers-two-year-8-million-contract-aaron-rodgers
Mason Rudolph is returning to the place he knows best in the NFL: Pittsburgh.

The veteran quarterback has agreed to a two-year, $8 million deal with the Steelers, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo reported Thursday. Rudolph's contract includes $4.5 million guaranteed.

Rudolph spent the 2024 season in Tennessee and found himself in the role of quarterback yo-yo, rising to starter in place of the injured Will Levis, falling back to the bench when Levis returned, and being pulled back into the action once coach Brian Callahan had exhausted his patience with Levis. All the while, Rudolph remained the same steady signal-caller, never elevating the Titans offense but providing a calming presence that the offense sorely needed after the tumult of the Levis experience.

It seems the Steelers' evolving quarterback situation could use that type of presence, making their reunion a logical pairing, even if Rudolph shouldn't expect to compete for the job (unless the Steelers don't land another starting-caliber quarterback this offseason).

Aaron Rodgers could potentially be the lead man in Pittsburgh following the four-time MVP's release from the Jets upon the start of the new league year. But as the NFL world awaits Rodgers' decision, which includes interest from other teams and perhaps even retirement, the Steelers are adding a familiar face to the QB room.

Rudolph began his career in Pittsburgh as a third-round pick in 2018 and spent a full year sitting behind Ben Roethlisberger before seeing any regular-season action. When the time came, he was certainly tossed into the fire, playing in 10 games (eight starts) in a wild 2019 season that also saw Pittsburgh turn to Devlin Hodges for six starts.

Over the course of Rudolph's first four seasons in Pittsburgh, he made 10 starts, appeared in 17 total games and briefly offered glimpses of a potential successor to Roethlisberger. Eventually, the Steelers learned Rudolph wasn't that guy, but was a rather reliable backup, which he proved in his final days in Pittsburgh by helping the Steelers win their final three games en route to a once-unlikely playoff berth in 2023.

With a year apart and both of the Steelers' 2024 starting quarterbacks no longer on the roster, they're welcoming Rudolph back into town. We'll see which veteran he lands behind on the depth chart as a trusted source of security.

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/ben-johnson-bears-offensive-line-moves-tough-gritty-dirty-individuals
The Chicago Bears made their offseason intentions abundantly clear, then went out and executed.

Ben Johnson's new club needed to get more rugged in the trenches. Through the early part of the offseason, they did just that, trading for guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and agreeing to terms with center Drew Dalman this week. On defense, they added beef in Grady Jarrett and Dayo Odeyingbo.

On Wednesday, the club held their press conference with trade acquisitions Thuney and Jackson, and Johnson highlighted the reason for adding the veteran people-movers.

"We want some tough, some gritty, some dirty individuals, and we feel pretty good about the two guys we got," the coach said, via the team's official website. "'Smart' is a word that comes to mind, particularly with the interior players. We would love to have some versatility to our scheme, some multiplicity if you will. We've got a couple guys in the building now that we feel strongly can handle a variety of different concepts and schemes that we might want to employ each and every week.

"Beyond that, their play speaks for themselves in terms of what the tape says. The character, the integrity, it's top notch. I can speak firsthand with Jonah, and (general manager) Ryan (Poles) can speak firsthand with Joe. I'm really, really excited to get these guys in the room. Combined with the coaches that we've already put together for that room, I feel really good about the style of play we'll have this year."

In 2024, the Bears' line had more holes than a block of Swiss cheese. Given the prices and limited supply in free agency, Poles was wise to turn to the trade market. Given Thuney's age and Jackson's injury history, there are some risks, but considering the circumstances, it's a win for Chicago.

Last year, the Bears' offseason was characterized by adding weapons and a rookie quarterback. This season, Johnson is emphasizing toughness in the trenches. The moves won't only help Caleb Williams in Year 2 but should also help open a ground game that struggled to find traction. The additions also provide flexibility in the draft, where perhaps Johnson takes another page from the Lions' book and acquires a running back early.

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/eagles-jalyx-hunt-work-my-butt-off-replace-josh-sweat-philadelphia-departures
The Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles will rely on youngsters on defense in their quest to repeat as Lombardi lifters.

Philly lost or moved on from a host of veteran defenders over the past week. Milton Williams inked a massive deal in New England, Josh Sweat got paid by Arizona, Oren Burks left for Cincinnati, Isaiah Rodgers landed in Minnesota, Chauncey Gardner-Johnson was traded to Houston, and Darius Slay was released and will move across the state to Pittsburgh.

The losses put more pressure on young players like Jalyx Hunt to step into the limelight for the NFL's top club.

"Hurting my heart," Hunt told Olivia Reiner of the Philadelphia Inquirer about losing teammates. "This is the business part that everybody talks about. So, this is my first time experiencing it. I'm going through the throes of it right now."

Hunt is one of the players tasked with replacing the production lost with Sweat's defection to play for former Eagles DC Jonathan Gannon in Arizona.

"That's the OG, man," Hunt said. "Josh Sweat, he's out of here. I told him, 'It's up,' though, because now we're in direct competition. Because before, I'm learning from you, everything. But now I've got to outrush him and everything like that."

The Eagles put more on Hunt's plate as the season wore on last season. Much of the increased snaps were due to injuries to Bryce Huff and Brandon Graham. But the third-round rookie's play also improved under Vic Fangio's tutelage. Hunt went from playing five total defensive snaps in the first five weeks to playing at least 30 percent of the reps in the final seven weeks of the regular season. In the playoffs, he generated 1.5 sacks to match his regular-season total.

General manager Howie Roseman noted that he expects a jump from Hunt and fellow youngster Moro Ojomo in 2025.

For Hunt, the raised expectations won't change his approach.

"I'm going to do what I did last year," Hunt said. "Just put my head down, work, study some more film, ask more questions. I feel as if I can ask better questions now that I know a little bit more about the position and I've played and I've got some experience at it. Just ask my butt off. Work my butt off."

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/baron-browning-on-returning-to-cardinals-if-you-got-a-girlfriend-who-is-a-10-why-play-around
Arizona Cardinals pass rusher Baron Browning passed up a chance at free agency, agreeing to a new two-year contract days before the negotiating window opened.

From the 26-year-old's perspective, he likes where he's at and saw no reason to move.

"If you got a girlfriend who is a 10, why play around?" Browning quipped to the "Cardinals Cover 2" podcast about his reason for returning.

Browning agreed to a two-year contract worth $15 million, with a max value of $19 million. The deal represents a still-growing player with the talent to burst out but one who has dealt with injury and must improve his consistency.

The former third-round pick by Denver in 2021 was traded midseason to Arizona after he missed the early part of the season with a foot injury and was squeezed out of the rotation. He found a home with Jonathan Gannon's club. From Weeks 10-18, Browning generated a 15.9 percent quarterback pressure rate, per Next Gen Stats, the 14th-best mark among edges with at least 100 pass rushes over that span.

"They kind of just let me go play, so that's also a good thing because as a player, you want to be able to go play fast," Browning of the Cardinals.

Pairing Browning with newly signed big-money addition Josh Sweat gives Gannon and defensive coordinator Nick Rallis more weapons after needing to generate pressure by bringing extra bodies last year. The moves won't stop Arizona from continuing to beef up the defensive front in the draft.

================================================================================

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/josh-allen-wanted-extension-to-give-bills-salary-cap-flexibility-to-chase-a-super-bowl
Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen got another big payday this past weekend, but the reigning NFL MVP wasn't looking to reset the market. Instead, he hoped his new deal would open up salary cap space in the short term so that the Bills could go shopping.

"I wasn't looking to absolutely kill them at every chance I could, and I told my agent that," he said on Wednesday. "I was like, if it has any impact on the cap, let's figure out a way to not do that. Both sides were willing to move and change different things and it was a pretty calm-mannered negotiation is what I can say from both sides."

Allen's six-year, $330 million extension, which included $250 million guaranteed, puts him second among quarterbacks with a $55 million-per-year average, tied with Joe Burrow, Jordan Love and Trevor Lawrence. He sits behind Dak Prescott's $60 million annual average.

"It's weird to say this, but what is $5 million more going to do for my life that I can't already do right now. It's not that crazy to me," Allen said. "I was like, if it has any impact on the cap, let's figure out a way to not do that."

Allen's contract reportedly takes up 19.7% of the team's total cap, ranking 13th.

It's nothing new for extensions to push down the cap number by spreading it to other seasons. It's a mechanism that every team uses to save immediate space and push the bloated cap figures to future years to be dealt with later. The maneuver is easy with salary cap projections continuing to climb.

The extension and other moves, like releasing Von Miller, freed up enough space to add the likes of defensive end Joey Bosa and wide receiver Josh Palmer in free agency and extend wide receiver Khalil Shakir, linebacker Terrel Bernard and defensive end Gregory Rousseau to long-term deals.

With an MVP award on his shelf and new money in his pocket, Allen is chasing the one thing that's eluded him thus far: a Lombardi Trophy.

"An 8-year-old me would obviously be just as pumped as a 28-year-old me. I think it's the only thing I've ever wanted to do in my life is play football. Now, I get to continue to do it. That's the main thing. Going out there and playing the best football that I can. In no way does this mean I need to stop working hard or stop getting better. It almost promotes more of that for me," Allen said. "I've got to continue to get better and find ways to help this team get over that hump and win a Super Bowl. ...

"When you kind of look back at it, the only thing missing is finishing our season with a win," he added. "That's really the only thing I'm thinking about, just trying to continue to get better and find a way to bring a Lombardi Trophy to western New York."

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/jets-officially-release-aaron-rodgers-veteran-qb-now-a-free-agent-for-first-time-in-career
As the NFL calendar turned to the new league year, Aaron Rodgers' release from the New York Jets became official with the release of the league transaction wire late Wednesday night.

Rodgers, a post-June 1 designation, is now free to sign with any team for the first time in his 20-year career. A few -- the New York Giants, Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings -- are said to be interested in adding the future Pro Football Hall of Famer.

Buzz regarding Rodgers picked up earlier in the week, when the Steelers were first reported to be pursuing the 41-year-old quarterback's services for the 2025 season. With teams waiting for Wednesday for Rodgers to become available after the Jets announced in February that he would not return, that's as far as movement on his future has advanced.

Pittsburgh has an increased need at quarterback following Justin Fields' decision to accept a two-year deal with the Jets, leaving the Steelers in a position in which they'd have to choose a veteran in order to fill the top spot on the roster. Given their stated desire to advance beyond where 2024 (and a number of previous seasons) finished -- a loss on Wild Card Weekend -- Rodgers appears to be a good fit, provided there's mutual interest.

The Giants present as an intriguing option, too, especially when considering Rodgers would only have to swap locker rooms at MetLife Stadium after spending 2023 and 2024 with the Jets.

Minnesota has surfaced as an option in recent days following the departures of Sam Darnold to Seattle and Daniel Jones to Indianapolis. The Vikings are suddenly in the market for a veteran backup -- or in Rodgers' case, potential starter -- to pair with 2024 first-round pick J.J. McCarthy, who only participated in one preseason game before his rookie campaign ended due to a knee injury.

A choice to head to Minnesota would complete the Brett Favre career path that Rodgers has unintentionally followed from Green Bay to New York. It might also present the most challenging scenario for Rodgers, who would logically only return to play in 2025 as a starting quarterback.

These questions and hypothetical scenarios have swirled throughout the week. With Rodgers now free to sign anywhere -- and even without a shred of a timeline -- we can brace for legitimate movement on the quarterback's destination before long.

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/saints-eight-time-pro-bowl-de-cameron-jordan-returning-for-15th-season-with-reworked-contract
The face of the New Orleans Saints franchise isn't going anywhere.

Cameron Jordan and the Saints agreed to a revised contract and he'll return in 2025 for his 15th season, NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero reported.

Jordan revealed his return on social media.

The 35-year-old eight-time Pro Bowler is coming off a 2024 season in which he had just 34 tackles and four sacks, but owned a $20 million cap number for his age-36 campaign. Jordan and New Orleans clearly came to a resolution for him to continue his outstanding career in the Big Easy.

A fixture in the community, Jordan was the Saints' Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year nominee in 2024 for the third time in his career.

He saw a potential exodus coming as evidenced by him soaking in the setting following a loss to the Las Vegas Raiders in the Saints' home finale last season. Jordan also had previously stated he intended to play in 2025 even if he wasn't with the Saints. That won't be necessary.

Instead, he's staying put with New Orleans hoping to help the club turn around its fortunes from a 5-12 showing last season and achieve some milestones.

Through 14 seasons, he's earned a spot on the Hall of Fame's All-2010s Team, stacked up six double-digit sack seasons and posted 233 QB hits, 716 tackles and 121.5 sacks.

Jordan's career numbers outline how impactful he has been for the franchise.

He's played 226 games -- incredibly missing only two in his career -- for the Saints, which is second all time behind Drew Brees' 228. His 121.5 sacks are also second in club chronicle behind only Hall of Famer Rickey Jackson's 123. One can surmise Jordan will surpass both standards with one more season in New Orleans.

Jordan has earned one All-Pro accolade, which came in 2017 when he tallied 13 sacks, a career-high 11 pass breakups, 62 tackles, 28 QB hits and had his lone career interception return for a touchdown. That 2017 campaign began a string of six straight Pro Bowl seasons for Jordan.

2017 was a pivotal year for Jordan and the franchise.

Though the Saints would ultimately fall short of reaching a Super Bowl, from 2017-2020, Jordan was one of the best pass rushers in the game and New Orleans was one of the finest franchises. In each season, the Saints won the NFC South and posted no fewer than 11 victories as Jordan averaged 12 sacks a year to lead the defense while Brees led a prolific offense.

The Saints haven't earned a playoff berth since 2020, though. As they embark on a new era under rookie head coach Kellen Moore -- who is two days younger than Jordan -- they will do so with Jordan back in the gold and black.

Season No. 14 is on deck for Harrison Smith.

Smith, a six-time Pro Bowl safety, is signing a one-year deal with the Minnesota Vikings worth $10.25 million with a max value of $14 million, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported Wednesday. The team later announced the signing.

Foregoing retirement for another go with the Vikes, the 36-year-old Smith will return to his familiar starting spot in Minnesota's defensive backfield.

A 2012 NFL Draft first-round selection of the Vikings, Smith has played 192 games -- all for Minnesota -- and is coming off a season in which he performed well in defensive coordinator Brian Flores' scheme, tallying 87 tackles, 10 pass breakups and three interceptions.

An all-time Viking who has at least one more year left in him, No. 22 isn't done yet.

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-free-agency-2025-what-we-learned-after-first-wave-of-roster-moves
It feels like NFL free agency has been roaring for a week, with more than half of Gregg Rosenthal's Top 101 free agents already off the market.

But Wednesday marks the actual start of the new league year. So for this rundown of what we've learned in the first wave of 2025 free agency, I'm going to focus on the most recent events, while keeping a wider lens on all the movement that has transpired to this point. We still don't know the answers to some major quarterback questions, while several big-name options remain available at wide receiver and on both lines of scrimmage.

Here are some thoughts on the latest moves in the flurry of trades and signings that kicked the offseason into high gear.

1) Denver adds reliable target for Nix. Broncos head coach Sean Payton has made it clear he wants to add offensive weaponry and flexibility for quarterback Bo Nix this offseason, seeking a "joker" type of piece he can move around and use to manipulate defenses. Is newly signed tight end Evan Engram that piece? Well, at the very least, he's part of the solution.

Engram has been a volume receiver the past three years in Jacksonville, averaging 5.4 catches per game in that span. And he was a reliable on-field presence, too, even as the Jaguars' quarterback play vacillated. Engram caught more than 76.7% of the passes thrown his way over that span.

That's an upgrade over the Broncos' top four tight ends from last year. Collectively, they caught 70.8% of their targets, but for a total of 51 catches, 483 and five TDs. Engram alone caught 47 passes in nine games. And, yes, he missed roughly half the season with injuries before being released by the Jaguars this offseason, but he did appear in all 17 games in each of the previous two seasons.

So I view Engram as an upgrade. But he can't be the only one. Engram will be 31 in Week 1, and he's lost the 4.4 speed he boasted coming out of college. Yes, he's a moveable chess piece who can line up in-line, in the slot, flexed out wide and even in the backfield. But Engram has averaged 8.9 yards per reception over his past four seasons, and his longest catch over that span was 36 yards. He's also not a big red-zone threat, with only 19 TD catches since the 2018 season.

I don't believe this signing should at all preclude Payton from seeking more help. If one of the draft's top two tight ends -- Penn State's Tyler Warren or Michigan's Colston Loveland -- is there for the Broncos in Round 1 (they currently own pick No. 20 overall), they should strongly consider either player. There also are some good Day 2 options.

Adding Engram is an encouraging start, but he's not known as a run blocker and can only fix some of the Broncos' problems. I'd like to see them pair Engram with another new TE addition, unless Payton believes that one of his holdovers can make a big jump up in their play.

2) Cowboys scoop up former first-rounders. Kaiir Elam just never quite worked in Buffalo. It happens; we've seen plenty of top-50 draft picks fail to make an impact in one spot, only to reemerge elsewhere. That's the hope for the Cowboys, who were badly in need of CB talent and have had some success with reclamation projects in recent years.

That said, I was a bit surprised the Bills were able to extract much of anything for Elam, who logged two interceptions and six passes defensed in 29 games over the past three seasons, much less the top-175 pick they snagged from Dallas as part of Wednesday's deal. Buffalo doesn't have a third-round selection (it went to the Browns in exchange for Amari Cooper), but it will have extra picks in Rounds 2, 4, 5 and 6, even after shipping away a sixth in the Elam swap.

Bills general manager Brandon Beane and his staff haven't always crushed their first-round selections outside of Josh Allen, but they have found some real gems outside of that round, including Taron Johnson, Spencer Brown, Khalil Shakir, Terrel Bernard, Ray Davis and others. Perhaps this year's draft class can help replenish some of the missing depth and add some youth to a roster that was on the older side a year ago.

As for the Cowboys, they didn't stop trading for former first-rounders there, later acquiring LB Kenneth Murray from Tennessee. The sixth-year pro has yet to become a star, but he has improved his tackling in recent years. Dallas still hasn't splurged for a free agent in many years, but if the Cowboys aren't going to spend big, there's some sense in taking a fixer-upper approach.

3) Bosa bolsters Buffalo's D. On a one-year deal worth up to $15.6 million, Joey Bosa appears to be a solid addition -- as long as the Bills know what they're getting.

Over the past three seasons, he has played in 28 games and missed 23, thanks to a slew of injuries. The reality is, though he doesn't turn 30 years old until July, Bosa appears to no longer be a three-down, 800-snap player, and he hasn't for some time now.

It might be too simple to say this is a one-for-one replacement for Von Miller, who is being released by the team after settling into a 20-25-snap role, mainly on passing downs, the past few seasons in Buffalo. But that's roughly what I expect for Bosa -- perhaps a tad more -- at this stage of his career.

The Chargers asked Bosa to carry a bit of a heavier load last year, somewhat out of need to fill out a slightly shallow defensive front, but I don't think Buffalo should be counting on Bosa to be a true bookend opposite Greg Rousseau, who was just handed a major extension. In a perfect world, Bosa and A.J. Epenesa will split work at one spot, with Rousseau at the other.

The Bills' formula is no secret: They want to be a takeaway and big-play defense while rushing four most often. They've ranked near the top of the league in fumbles and interceptions the past few seasons, and Bosa is among the active leaders in forced fumbles (tied for 16th). He also still brings some juice as a pass rusher, and that was an area where Buffalo fell off last season, so Bosa can help.

But it all hinges on his health, and the Bills have to be prepared for Bosa to miss time. If the past three seasons mean anything, counting on 17 games from him would appear to be quixotic.

4) Pierce says goodbye. A fond farewell to Ravens NT Michael Pierce, who announced his retirement Wednesday after eight seasons in the NFL. Pierce's journey was a feel-good story, and not just for those of us who are saps for the big guys. He was also an undrafted free agent in 2016 who carved out a role in Baltimore, earned a nice payday in Minnesota and then, in 2022, found his way back to Baltimore, where it all started.

And there are few better ways to cap a career for a 350-plus pounder than what Pierce managed. At home in Week 18, on his final regular-season snap, Pierce dropped into coverage and jumped Bailey Zappe's errant throw, recording his *first* career pick. I still wish Pierce had tried to house it (and he might have been able to!), but he made the smart play and went down. Then he was rightfully mobbed by his teammates.

The writing seemed to be on the wall as far as his role with the Ravens. Last season, he became a part-time nose tackle, ceding snaps to Travis Jones. Pierce might not have been able to win a Super Bowl, but he bucked the odds to become a fine player, not to mention a favorite among fans and in the locker room.

5) Steelers take a swing on Slay. Darius Slay was connected to the Steelers over the past few days, though he maintained the possibility of returning to Philadelphia remained alive. The latter hypothetical became null and void on Wednesday when Slay joined the Steelers on a one-year, $10 million deal.

I'm always a bit leery about older cornerbacks in general, and I am not further reassured by the 34-year-old Slay's recent quote about wanting "to play one more year, for sure," which seems to leave open the possibility he won't play any more. What can the Steelers reasonably get from him?

Slay isn't the playmaker he once was, with only two picks over his past 37 regular-season games and none in his past 20, although he did intercept a pass in the playoffs and has gotten his hands on plenty of pass breakups in that span. It would be reasonable to assume the six-time Pro Bowler has lost a step.

But the Steelers needed bodies at the position, and adding Slay and Brandin Echols gives them two more outside corners to utilize opposite Joey Porter Jr., preventing them from having to hope Cory Trice Jr. develops. Now they might just need some competition at nickel, where Beanie Bishop made some early noise as an undrafted rookie last season before fading.

The Steelers already had an older roster prior to adding Slay, and they might even get older when they settle on a quarterback, which ups the ante for the 2025 season. This says to me Mike Tomlin still believes this team is close to contending for a Super Bowl -- or as close as a team can get without having a starting QB lined up yet.

6) Tennessee upgrades O-line -- and tips hand on draft plans? The Titans did not get off to a blazing fast start in free agency, but they appear to have shored up one big concern: the offensive line.

I know it might have been eyebrow-raising to see Dan Moore land a deal that gives him a higher APY ($20.5 million) than Ronnie Stanley ($20 million), especially given that Moore was credited by Pro Football Focus with allowing 12 sacks in Pittsburgh last season. But Moore was blocking for Russell Wilson and Justin Fields, the most-sacked and fourth-most sacked quarterbacks, respectively, over the past four NFL seasons. That context matters.

Moore, 26, might not be a world-beater, but he's an upgrade at an important position. Another upgrade came Wednesday with the addition of guard Kevin Zeitler, a pro's pro who turned 35 a few days ago but can still operate at a high level for the short term. Both have been extremely durable over the past few years, which is a big help.

Those moves would allow the Titans to kick 2024 first-rounder JC Latham to right tackle (his best position, in my opinion) and push Nicholas Petit-Frere to the bench. In recent years, Tennessee gave a healthy amount of snaps to Petit-Frere and outgoing free agents Dillon Radunz and Daniel Brunskill, players who are good as backups but demand an upgrade as starters. With a few signings, the Titans appear to have done just that.

These moves might also give us a hint as to the Titans' plans with the first overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. We've seen no movement at quarterback and no reported visits from the likes of Russell Wilson or Aaron Rodgers. Sure, they could take Abdul Carter or Travis Hunter, both of whom could be the "generational talent" they don't want to pass up at No. 1.

Yet, this very much feels like table-setting to make Cam Ward the first pick. I'm sure the Titans have not bailed all the hay on that decision yet, and passing on elite non-QBs like Carter or Hunter can be dangerous business, unless they're sold on the idea that Ward can be a difference-maker. But they can't just march into 2025 with Will Levis and a scrap-heap veteran and expect to energize the fanbase after three straight losing seasons.

If I had to guess right now based on the moves they've made to this point, Ward feels like a strong possibility. We're still six weeks removed from the draft, but to me, that's becoming a more likely situation right now.

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/panthers-signing-former-cowboys-1-000-yard-rusher-rico-dowdle-to-one-year-deal
After a breakout season with the Dallas Cowboys, running back Rico Dowdle is on the move.

Dowdle is signing a one-year deal worth up to $6.25 million with the Carolina Panthers, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo reported. Carolina announced the deal, as well.

The addition of Dowdle, who churned out a career-best 1,079 rushing yards in 2024 with the Cowboys, makes for an intriguing backfield stable for the Panthers.

Dowdle will join Chuba Hubbard, who's likewise coming off a career-high 1,195-yard showing, and Jonathon Brooks, a 2024 second-round selection who's been hampered by injuries. Dowdle heads to Charlotte after the Panthers recently released running back Miles Sanders.

Dowdle's departure from Dallas leaves the Cowboys' RB room especially barren, with former Denver Broncos running back Javonte Williams signing a one-year, $3 million deal and Deuce Vaughn remaining. Dallas' current status at the position will only add to the buzz of the team drafting a running back in April.

The 26-year-old Dowdle is a North Carolina native who played college ball at South Carolina.

An undrafted free agent who was with the Cowboys from 2020 through 2024, Dowdle showed plenty of potential in a 361-yard 2023 season, but finally got his shot to be the lead back down the stretch in 2024. He had four 100-yard games over the last six games with the Cowboys.

Just how much run he gets in head coach Dave Canales' offense remains to be seen, but Dowdle showed what he could do in 2024 and in 2025 he'll be the latest weapon added around quarterback Bryce Young for a rising Panthers offense.

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/former-cowboys-pass-rusher-demarcus-lawrence-signing-three-year-contract-with-seahawks
The Seattle Seahawks have made a splash on the first day of the new league year.

The Seahawks are signing former Cowboys pass rusher Demarcus Lawrence to a three-year contract worth up to $42 million with $18 million guaranteed, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport, Tom Pelissero and Mike Garafolo reported on Monday.

Lawrence spent the first 11 seasons of his career in Dallas, where he made four Pro Bowls and recorded 61.5 sacks.

Around The NFL will have more on this news soon.

Less than two weeks after describing remaining Dallas as a "glorious" idea, Demarcus Lawrence is packing his bags.

The free agent defensive end is signing a three-year deal worth up to $42 million with the Seattle Seahawks, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport, Tom Pelissero and Mike Garafolo reported on Wednesday. The deal includes $18 million guaranteed.

Lawrence had spent his entire pro career with the Cowboys after Dallas made him the 34th pick of the 2014 draft, but at 32 years old, it seemed as if Lawrence might finally consider another home away from the team that franchise tagged him twice in the past and handed him a five-year, $105 million deal back in 2019. At the beginning of March, Lawrence claimed the ball was in the Cowboys' court, adding "I'm not only going to play in Dallas."

Less than two weeks later, his prophecy came true. Lawrence leaves the Cowboys to join a Seahawks defense on the rise, jumping from a 30th-place finish in total yards allowed in 2023 all the way up to 14th in their first year under defensive-minded head coach Mike Macdonald. After sweeping changes on the offensive side, Macdonald's defense might need to become Seattle's backbone in 2025, explaining their willingness to sign a 32-year-old veteran to an affordable, but relatively lengthy deal.

As Lawrence trades Cowboys silver and blue for Seahawks blue and action green, he'll bring with him four Pro Bowl selections, 61.5 career sacks, 450 career tackles (including 97 for loss) and 126 quarterback hits. He's remained steady over his 11 NFL seasons and after missing 13 games in 2024 -- rendering the $20.4 million dedicated to him by Dallas all but useless -- he'll aim to get back on track in Seattle.

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/evan-engram-broncos-sign-two-time-pro-bowl-tight-end-two-year-deal
Bo Nix's stellar rookie campaign came with little production from the tight end position.

In an effort to remedy that, the Denver Broncos are signing two-time Pro Bowl tight end Evan Engram to a two-year deal, Engram's agent announced Wednesday. Engram's contract is worth $23 million and includes $16.5 million full guaranteed, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport, Mike Garafolo and Tom Pelissero reported.

The Broncos won an AFC West battle for Engram, who had visits with the Los Angeles Chargers on Tuesday and Denver on Monday.

Following a 10-7 showing last season in which Denver advanced to the playoffs for the first time since the 2015 campaign, Broncos general manager George Paton opined that the team had a good "young nucleus and a great quarterback to build around."

Engram's signing is the first significant move in improving the offense and adding skill around Nix.

The 30-year-old tight end is now set to play with his fourth first-round starting quarterback, as he began his career with Eli Manning and the New York Giants, moving on to Daniel Jones with Big Blue and then joining Trevor Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Engram was released by the Jaguars in a somewhat surprising move for salary cap savings. In a shallow free-agency tight end market, Engram became a hot commodity -- settling in as Gregg Rosenthal's No. 32 overall free agent.

A 2017 first-round selection of the Giants, Engram largely underwhelmed in five Gotham seasons before finding the right fit in Duval. He had 187 receptions for 1,729 yards and eight touchdowns from 2022-23 with the Jaguars, including a 2023 Pro Bowl selection.

Injuries limited his availability and productivity in a nine-game 2024 that saw him struggle to 47 catches for 365 yards and one score.

The Broncos are banking on him returning to form in his age-31 season and giving Nix another weapon at his disposal.

With Javonte Williams gone at running back and the wide receiver room needing additions to supplement Courtland Sutton and Marvin Mims Jr., Engram is a good first start in building an arsenal for Nix. Last season, Broncos starting tight end Adam Trautman had nary 13 receptions in 17 games, with Lucas Krull's 19 grabs the most among TEs on the team.

Finding a bona fide pass catcher at tight end was a massive need for Denver and Nix. Engram should be able to bolster the Broncos in that regard as he aims to rebound from a down-and-out year in Duval.

================================================================================

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/kaiir-elam-bills-cowboys-trade
The Dallas Cowboys are adding some first-round talent to bolster their defense.

Dallas is acquiring cornerback Kaiir Elam in a trade with the Buffalo Bills and linebacker Kenneth Murray in a trade with the Tennessee Titans, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported Wednesday.

The Cowboys are sending a 2025 fifth-round pick and 2026 seventh-round pick to the Bills in exchange for Elam and a 2025 sixth-round selection, per Pelissero. Buffalo confirmed the deal shortly after Pelissero's report.

Dallas and Tennessee are swapping late-round picks in the deal for Murray, Rapoport reported.

Murray was selected 23rd overall by the Los Angeles Chargers in 2020 and played four years with the Bolts before starting 14 games and tallying 95 tackles for the Titans last season. In his career, Murray has tallied 416 tackles, 8.5 sacks and 12 pass breakups.

Elam arrived in Buffalo as a first-round pick in 2022 but never rose to true starter status, making 12 starts over three seasons. An injury shortened his sophomore campaign to three games, and while he found a fit in Buffalo's secondary (and recorded an overall grade that landed him inside the top 50 of all corners in 2024, per PFF), the Bills decided to trade him in order to recoup some assets as Elam enters his fourth season.

Given Elam's lack of usage, it was highly unlikely the Bills were going to exercise his fifth-year option, making 2025 a prove-it season for the corner. He'll attempt to do so in Dallas, where the Cowboys have dealt with injuries at the position over the last two seasons and were seeking to add depth to their secondary.

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/rams-to-release-all-pro-wr-cooper-kupp-after-failing-to-find-trade
Unable to find a trade, the Rams have moved on from Cooper Kupp all on their own.

Los Angeles informed the All-Pro wideout it will be releasing him on Wednesday following eight seasons together, NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero reported. The team subsequently announced the release following the start of the new league year at 4 p.m. ET.

By releasing Kupp ahead of June 1, the Rams save $7.5 million in 2025 but take on $22.3 million in dead money.

Kupp, who announced on Feb. 3 that the team was seeking to trade him "immediately," departs a franchise hero with the third-most receptions (634) and receiving touchdowns (57) and fourth-most receiving yards (7,776) in Rams history.

He joined the Rams in 2017 and soon established himself as a third-round stud before finding another stratosphere thanks to L.A.'s addition of quarterback Matthew Stafford in 2021.

In their first season together, Kupp won the receiving triple crown and Offensive Player of the Year with 145 receptions for 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns. He averaged 119.5 receiving yards across the club's four playoff games while adding six more TD catches, including two scores as Super Bowl LVI Most Valuable Player to help power the Rams to a Lombardi Trophy.

Injuries have run their course since, causing Kupp to miss 17 total games across the past three seasons. His combined stat line from 2022-24 eclipses his triple-crown triumph by only 56 catches, 312 yards and one TD catch.

He looked especially worn down at the conclusion of his final year in L.A., averaging two catches and 28.2 yards per game over his last five contests.

Still, Kupp will still be a sought-after wideout heading into his age-32 season. There's a chance his struggles to end the 2024 campaign were more tied to coming off a high ankle sprain, and he makes up for whatever physical decline was real with crisp route-running, sure hands and always being in the perfect position.

Teams from championship contenders all the way down to rebuilders looking for a mentor will have interest, especially now that it won't take giving up an asset to add him.

The Rams, meanwhile, are set to move on with Puka Nacua as the face of their wide receiver room, with new addition Davante Adams filling Kupp's shoes as WR2.

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/2024-performance-based-pay-distributions-announced-jets-lb-jamien-sherwood
NFL players will receive over $452 million in Performance-Based Pay for their performance during the 2024 season, the NFL announced today. The Performance-Based Pay program is a collectively bargained benefit that compensates all players based upon their playing time and salary levels.

New York Jets' linebacker Jamien Sherwood  earned the highest amount among all NFL players for the 2024 League Year Performance-Based Pay program. His $1,092,206 distribution will more than double his 2024 salary. Sherwood was the Jets' 2021 fifth-round draft choice out of Auburn. He participated in 92.8% of plays on defense and over 26% of the club's special team plays.

Players have been paid nearly $2.8 billion cumulatively since the inception of the Performance-Based Pay program, which was implemented during the 2002 season as part of the NFL's Collective Bargaining Agreement with the NFL Players Association, and has been carried forward in three subsequent collective bargaining agreements.

How Performance-Based Pay Works

Under the Performance-Based Pay program, a fund is created and used as a supplemental form of player compensation based upon a comparison of playing time to salary. Players become eligible to receive a bonus distribution in any regular season in which they play at least one official down. In general, players with higher playtime percentages and lower salaries benefit most from the pool.

Performance-Based Pay is computed by using a player index ("Index"). To calculate the Index, a player's "PBP Playtime" (defined as the player's regular season total plays played on offense, defense and special teams, divided by the number of plays in which the player with the most total combined plays participated on that team) is divided by his "PBP Compensation" (defined as each player's regular season full salary, including his prorated portion of signing bonus, and earned incentives). Each player's Index is then compared to those of all other players on his team to determine the amount of his Performance-Based Pay. If a player's full season salary is less than the CBA Minimum Salary for a player with seven or more Credited Seasons, additional salary will be imputed to that player so that his salary is equal to the Minimum Salary for a player with seven or more Credited Seasons (i.e., $1.21M for the 2024 season). By imputing a minimum salary of $1.21 million, a slightly higher percentage of the pool is directed to high-performing veteran players whose salaries exceed $1.21 million, but are not among the highest in the League, as contemplated by the formula. This imputation of salary is solely for the purpose of calculating distributions from the pool and does not affect the actual salary paid to the player under his contract.

Illustration Of Performance-Based Pay System

Each player on the same team comÂ­petes for his own share of his club's Performance-Based Pay pool. The hypothetical example in the table below illustrates how the Player Index works, using a simplified four-player team and a club bonus pool of $1,000,000. Each player receives his share of the pool depending on how his Index compares to those of his teammates.

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/bills-safety-damar-hamlin-agree-to-terms-on-one-year-deal
Damar Hamlin isn't going anywhere.

Hamlin's remarkable NFL journey will see him stay put in Buffalo after he agreed to a one-year contract extension, the Bills announced Wednesday. Hamlin will earn $2 million on his new deal, NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero reported.

The 26-year-old Hamlin is entering his third season since suffering a cardiac arrest on Jan. 2, 2023, during a Bills game against the Cincinnati Bengals.

Hamlin's 2024 season was his most productive as a pro, as the safety started 14 games for the Bills with a career-best five pass breakups and his first two career interceptions to go along with 89 tackles.

A sixth-round draft choice of Buffalo in 2021, Hamlin has played in 48 career games with 27 starts and 184 career tackles.

Hamlin was a starter by his second season before tragedy struck during a Week 17 game at Cincinnati.

Hamlin collided with Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins on a play. The impact resulted in him suffering commotio cordis, which led to Hamlin's cardiac arrest. CPR was performed as he laid on the field. He was then transported by ambulance to the University of Cincinnati. Hamlin, who was in critical condition, remained in hospital care for more than a week before he was discharged Jan. 11, 2023.

His first season back -- one in which the Bills were rife with talent and depth in the defensive backfield -- saw him play in five games.

This past year was different, though, as Hamlin played a starting role in the Bills winning their fifth straight AFC East title.

Now, Hamlin will be back as Buffalo looks for a sixth consecutive division trophy and another chance at vying for an elusive Super Bowl crown.

Could Aaron Rodgers continue to walk the Brett Favre path by closing out his career in Minnesota?

Favre spent 16 years in Green Bay before a quick stopover with the New York Jets ahead of closing his Hall of Fame career with two years in Minnesota. Rodgers, who spent three years as Favre's understudy, played 18 years in Green Bay and the past two with Gang Green. Minnesota is one option for Rodgers to continue his career, along with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New York Giants.

During an interview on Fox News' The Will Cain Show, Favre encouraged the Vikings connection.

"By all means, sign with them. They got a really good football team. They're loaded at pretty much every position," Favre said. "They made it to the playoffs last year. They got a tremendous fan base, much like the Packers. If you get the opportunity, that's a good place to win. Of course, you gotta play the Packers then."

Favre said he appreciated the Packers-Vikings rivalry more after playing in Minnesota.

"Love-hate relationship at its best," Favre said. "That's what makes it such a great rivalry. I got to see it from both sides. It made me appreciate both sides even more. If he gets an opportunity, why not?"

The Steelers and Giants present a greater chance for Rodgers to start. With J.J. McCarthy returning from injury and ready to take over the gig, it wouldn't be a shoo-in that the 41-year-old would start. However, Minnesota would offer the best offense. We know Kevin O'Connell's scheme is dynamite, and they boast the highest-paid wideout in football, Justin Jefferson. The Vikings also bulked up the offensive line this offseason. If Rodgers thought there was a shot at unseating McCarthy, Minnesota would be a cushy gig.

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/bengals-te-mike-gesicki-comfortable-paying-joe-burrow-tax-to-stay-in-cincinnati
Cincinnati Bengals tight end Mike Gesicki had no issues taking a little less money to catch passes from Joe Burrow.

The tight end re-signed in Cincinnati on a three-year contract worth $25.5 million, with $12 million in Year 1.

"I definitely knew that I was going to take the 'Joe Burrow tax,' " Gesicki said, referring to a discount needed to stay, via the Dayton Daily News. "So, I knew that, and I was like, I'm cool with it. And so, it makes it easy to come back to a place like this. â¦ There's so many different guys (in the organization) that were in the back of my mind as I'm thinking about, you know, do I test the market?

"You hear about your value and all that kind of stuff and what it could be, and at that point, it's just like, this is what I want. I wanted to go to Cincinnati, and I wanted to be in an offense that allowed me to reach my potential, and I think that this place gives me everything I'm looking for."

With the Bengals needing to pay the likes of Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, Gesicki said he didn't want to take "too big of a chunk" of cap space.

The $8.5 million-per-year pact puts the 30-year-old Gesicki at the mid-level of his position, behind the Patriots' Hunter Henry ($9 million). Even considering he's closer to a slot receiver than an in-line blocking tight end, it's still a sizable chunk for the budget-conscious Bengals.

After a stellar start to his career, including back-to-back 700-yard seasons playing a wideout role in Miami in 2020 and 2021, Gesicki struggled to find a role in 2022 under Mike McDaniel in South Beach and 2023 in New England. In Burrow's offense, however, he got back on track, generating 665 yards and two TDs on 65 grabs last season. He might never be confused with a George Kittle-type tight end, but in the Bengals offense, Gesicki found a role.

Entering Year 8, he said he "owes a lot" to Burrow, and "having the best quarterback on planet Earth have your back" helps. The TE was one of the key players that the star QB mentioned Cincy needed to retain this offseason.

"I'm going to work my tail off every single day for the Cincinnati Bengals," Gesicki said. "But for Joe Burrow, because, I mean, he did so much for my career last year, just giving me the opportunity and believing in me and trusting me that, 'Hey, Mike's gonna win, I'm gonna throw the ball here,' when you got Ja'Marr or Tee who are attracting attention. But then off the field doing things like that, just mentioning my name and things like that. So, it was awesome."

The Bengals hung onto one piece of the offense. Now it's on to figuring out how to keep the rest of the crew happy and paid.

URL: https://www.nfl.com/news/buccaneers-wr-chris-godwin-reveals-he-was-really-close-to-leaving-tampa-bay
Chris Godwin elected to leave money on the table to re-sign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The choice was more about family and being comfortable than chasing dinero.

"I mean, to be honest, I feel like we were really close (to leaving)," Godwin told Sara Walsh and Mike Garafolo on Tuesday on NFL Network's The Insiders. "When it comes to a situation like that, you have to really, really consider it. Me and (his wife) Mariah, we had some really tough conversations. Had some really tough conversations with my agent. Because at the end of the day, you're trying to figure out what's going to be best for our family. Not everybody would make that decision, and I'm not faulting anybody that would.

"But at the end of the day, like I was mentioning in the presser, I have to go based off my gut, I have to go based off my intuition and what I think is going to be best for us in the long run. Being here, where we call home, where we feel the most comfortable, where we can raise our newborn son, I think all those things are big factors for us in making this decision."

Godwin inked a three-year, $66 million contract to remain in Tampa alongside Mike Evans and rising youngster Jalen McMillan.

Despite Godwin coming off a season-ending ankle injury, his market was still hot. He could have reportedly made $20 million more if he left the Bucs. Instead, Godwin, with a 2 Â½-month-old son, elected to keep his family in Tampa.

General manager Jason Licht, who has done a miraculous job keeping the core pieces in place in Tampa, said it's on the franchise to continually earn that trust.

"People always give us credit for betting on Chris during his injuries," Licht said, via the Tampa Bay Times. "But he and Mariah bet on us and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that we make it right for you and chase another ring. ...

"You're supposed to stand here before fans and say I don't get stressed and I have ice in my veins. But I don't. It's an emotional time. So it took everything out of me not to be texting Chris and be like you're texting your girlfriend. My wife had to say, 'Don't push him.' So when it got over with, it was an awesome moment."

Keeping Godwin on a team-friendly deal will allow Licht to spend elsewhere as the Bucs chase a fifth-straight NFC South division title.

Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Poles is on an offseason heater, completely revamping the trenches in hopes of a swift turnaround for a five-win club under new coach Ben Johnson.

Chicago acquired guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson in trades, agreed to terms with center Drew Dalman, and added edge rusher Dayo Odeyingbo and defensive tackle Grady Jarrett to big-money pacts.

More than just Bears fans have noticed the moves. Even foes are impressed with what Poles has accomplished thus far this offseason.

On the St. Brown Podcast, Detroit Lions star receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown sounded exasperated discussing all the Bears' big moves.

"I feel like the Bears have unlimited f---ing money," St. Brown said. "This s--- is crazy. They're just signing new s--- for like $40-50 million. Joe Thuney, boom. Jonah Jackson, bang. Drew Dalman, bang. Dayo Odeyingbo, another crazy amount of money. Grady Jarrett, bang. They're just breaking everybody off. They have unlimited money. What the f--- is this? ... Ben is just making moves left and right."

Chicago did enter the offseason with a hoard of cap space, partly due to its quarterback, Caleb Williams, being on a rookie contract and partly because the team has whiffed on its draft picks in recent years, rarely giving out second, big-money deals.

Whereas the Lions inked St. Brown, a fourth-round pick in 2021, to a four-year, $120.01 million extension, the Bears have exactly zero players left on their roster from that draft year.

Most of Chicago's big-money players were acquired via trade (Montez Sweat, DJ Moore, Thuney, Jackson) or free agency (Tremaine Edmunds, D'Andre Swift). Jaylon Johnson and Cole Kmet are the key home-grown talents given long-term deals.

Poles hopes last year's draft, highlighted by first-rounders Williams and Rome Odunze, will one day earn big-money extensions. Until then, however, he'll have money to burn.
Chicago did well in diving into the trenches, bringing in veterans with experience to bolster the club's weakness. The trajectory under Ben Johnson is clearer than it's been in years in Chicago.

However, building through free agency is a tricky proposition. There is a reason most players -- usually due to age or injury history -- are available. Last year, the Bears were praised for bringing in a collection of weapons. That plan didn't lead to wins. Spending on the trenches is a smarter use of cap space this time, but it needs to pan out in the fall.

There will be no brotherly reunion by the Bay.

Five-time Pro Bowl pass rusher Joey Bosa is signing with the Buffalo Bills on a one-year, $12.6 million deal, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday night. The contract offers a max value of $15.6 million, according to Rapoport.

Recently cut loose by the Los Angeles Chargers after nine seasons and 72 sacks, Bosa joining his younger brother Nick with the San Francisco 49ers was a much-anticipated move. Instead, Bosa will join the reigning AFC East champions, who just released another veteran pass-rush specialist, Von Miller.

Bosa, 29, is six years Miller's junior, and the Bills are hoping he can add a young veteran presence and supplement a pass rush led by Greg Rousseau and A.J. Epenesa.

The Chargers parted ways with Bosa, a franchise standard sine he was drafted No. 3 overall in 2016, to save $26.36 million. It's fair to wonder if Bosa didn't join his brother in San Francisco because the 49ers have spent much of free agency so far letting past talent depart.

Regardless, Bosa -- other than a drastic change in climate going from Southern California to Western New York -- seems to have found a great fit.

The Bills will continue their quest for an elusive Super Bowl trophy with a pass rusher who's no doubt hungry for playoff success. Bosa's been part of just one postseason victory in nearly a decade, as the Bolts advanced to the playoffs in three of his nine campaigns with a 1-3 showing.

He'll join a squad accustomed to success, having gone to the playoffs six years running with five straight AFC East crowns.

Bosa's coming off a 2024 season in which he had only five sacks in 14 games (nine starts), but owns 72 for his career on the strength of four double-digit sack campaigns.

Perhaps the biggest question for both parties going forward will be how Bosa's health holds up. He's dealt with various injuries over the years and missed 23 games over the past three seasons.

If a healthy and re-energized version of Bosa emerges in 2025, the Bills might well get the result they were hoping for when they inked Miller three years ago.
